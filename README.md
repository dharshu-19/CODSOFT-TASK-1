Travel Website Landing Page - CodSoft Task 1

In this project, I used HTML and CSS to complete the landing page for a travel website. I had a great experience working on this task, and the landing page is designed to be neat and responsive. It is divided into sections such as the header and footer to ensure a clean and organized layout. The Travel Website Landing Page project showcases a visually appealing and functional landing page for a travel website, including sections such as a hero image, featured destinations, services, testimonials, and a contact form, all styled to create a cohesive and engaging user experience.
